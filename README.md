# Chrisco-Cinemas: End-to-End Data Insights

This project is a hands-on exploration of cinema operations, where I analyzed 10,000+ records to uncover seasonal patterns, resource inefficiencies, and marketing blind spots — using **Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel**.
I didn’t just build dashboards — I asked, *“What would I do if this were my business?”*

## Highlights

- **Power BI** dashboard (w/ DAX): Mapped weekly visits and occupancy trends across 20+ cinemas, revealing demand cycles.
- **8+ Tableau visuals**: Compared ROI, spend vs visits, and cost per visitor, guiding better marketing strategy.
- **Python EDA**: Clustered cinema behavior, found seasonal peaks, and exposed venues underperforming relative to capacity.
- **Excel modeling**: Proposed 3 optimization strategies — projecting a **15% boost in operational efficiency**.

## Why It Mattered (To Me)

This project taught me how to **connect data to decisions** — not just analyze, but explain, simplify, and recommend. It pushed me to think like both a **data analyst** and a **business strategist**, translating insights into clear, visual stories.

I now build for outcomes, not just outputs.
